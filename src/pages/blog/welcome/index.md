I’m working on continually expanding my web development experiences, and I plan on using this new site format to do so. My portfolio site has gone through several design iterations as I’ve progressed in my skills:

1. Non-responsive simple HTML and CSS
2. Moderately responsive default Bootstrap CSS with simple HTML
3. ReactJS powered single page app
4. Express generated app using Handlebars templating

My portfolio is sort of a testing ground for new things I’m learning. This brings me to my current tech stack which was built with the help of KeystoneJS. I feel that I’ve gained enough knowledge in various areas of Javascript to be able to better understand what KeystoneJS does and how it does it. I dabbled with it several months ago, but found my understanding of things like MongoDB and routing to be lacking. This led me on a path of learning which ultimately brought me back to redesigning my portfolio yet again with KeystoneJS.

While I’m not yet utilizing KeystoneJS to it’s full potential, I keep getting drawn back to it as a CMS and hope to learn more of it’s intricacies. While I don’t mind hand coding everything myself, I like the idea of using this platform for clients to allow them a level of control over their site content. My goal is to use Keystone often enough to become familiar with it and use it in my other projects going forward.

Going into this post, I didn’t know what I expected to write. I consume content from blog posts all the time, but never went so far as to produce content myself. I plan on trying to make this a habit and brush up on my writing skills to catalog my web development journey. I wouldn’t go as far as calling myself an expert in any area, but I like the thought of some of my findings being useful to others coming after me.
