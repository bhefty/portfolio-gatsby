Vote on user generated polls! View and vote without an account, or create an account to make your own polls. As a user with an account you can monitor the results of your polls as well as create more or delete some of your own once finished with them.

### Technology

Built upon a Node backend with React on the front. Poll data is managed with MongoDB using routes from the server handled by Express.
